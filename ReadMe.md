## Introduction to Recommender System

Recommender systems are algorithms that mimic the psychology and personality of humans, in order to predict their needs and desires. 

There are many different types of techniques and implementations out there.

- **Content-based methods** uses attributes of items to recommend to users new items similar to what the user has liked in the past (doesn't take into account the behaviour of other users);
- **Collaborative Filtering methods** uses similarities between users and items simultaneously to determine recommendations;
- **Hybrid methos** mix content-based and collaborative filtering approaches.

Other approaches are also called **Knowlege-based methods** which uses explicit knowledge about users and items to build recommendations criteria with a rule-based approach.
